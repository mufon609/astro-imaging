# Dead-end registry + acquisition checklist

Durable, arch-independent field lessons: the processing dead-ends never to
re-attempt (each with its mechanism), and the acquisition choices that outrank
any processing knob. **Read the dead-end registry before proposing ANY
experiment** — if a thing does not work, the mechanism why is here. Full detail
+ the original numbers live in git history (the NOTES at the commit whose message
begins `checkpoint:` — `git log --oneline --grep='^checkpoint:'`).

## Dead-end registry — do NOT re-attempt

Data / physics / tool-doctrine mechanism lessons.

**Gain / flat** (self-calibration — real flats are the primary path; when they
have issues, synthetic-flat / vignetting correction is a GAP to fill with an
OFFICIAL tool, never an in-house fit. The entries below are methods that FAIL —
the constraints any such tool must satisfy):
- A free-form gain fit bakes sky glow into the gain (peaks off-axis toward the
  glow) — sanity-check any gain by its centre.
- A polynomial radial V(r) oscillates → concentric RINGS after division; only a
  monotone isotonic V is admissible. A per-channel V tints the corners (glow
  contaminates the per-channel falloff) → V must be GRAY.
- The true V lies between the multiplicative and additive fits of the median;
  only the empirical V2 of the frames ACTUALLY being divided is flat.
- Never refine the gain from the STACK's residual — the sky's own structure
  (MW/glow/clouds) exceeds the residual, giving opposite-sign results.
- A SKY FLAT (median of un-registered lights) captures vignetting + dust motes +
  PRNU, but a frame-filling faint complex (MW/IFN) does NOT reject — it bakes into
  the flat and division ATTENUATES the cosmic dust. The only fix is manual
  clone-stamping (GUI, non-reproducible). So the sky flat is dust-safe ONLY when
  faint structure is a small part of the frame; validate before use
  ([`synthetic-flats-and-bias.md`](synthetic-flats-and-bias.md)).
- A sky flat applied ACROSS SETS imprints the SOURCE set's sky. The flat's
  low-order component carries the residual sky gradient of the lights it was
  built from; the sensor-fixed content (vignetting/motes/PRNU) transfers between
  same-session sets but the sky term does NOT — dividing another pointing's
  lights by it prints that gradient into them. Measured (one knob, linear
  regional medians on the SPCC'd stacks): set-03 under set-01's flat = ±6% L-R
  tilt (corners 88–101 on a ~94.5 centre); under its own flat = flat to ~1–2%;
  stars +8%/Mpx, off-axis aberration 0.49 → 0.37 px
  (`datasets/july14/set-03/experiments.jsonl` flat_source_set03). **USER-RATIFIED
  RULE: a flat calibrates ONLY the exact frames it was built from** — never
  another set, and never a multi-set combine under any single set's (or a
  union) flat: each member set calibrates with its OWN flat before composing.
  Per-set builder with validation gates: `scripts/stack/build_sky_flat.sh`.

**Background:**
- The MW band IS frame-scale curvature at wide focal → `seqsubsky 2` erases it;
  only a first-degree plane or a full BGE is MW-safe.
- Stack-level-only BGE leaves a STRUCTURED residual (visible rings, loses MW);
  per-frame `subsky 1` is the MW-safe background step.
- GraXpert AI smoothing is NOT faint-nebulosity protection — smoothing blurs the
  model OUTPUT, not the inference; a frame-filling faint complex reads as the
  trained light-pollution class and is absorbed. Use a plane/off for
  object-filling fields. BGE does NOT absorb a centred galaxy's halo (it measures
  STRONGER against a lower far-field sky).
- On a union/max canvas, CROP to the verified coverage frame BEFORE any
  background step: `subsky`'s sample grid ingests the canvas's zero-coverage
  rims — its `-tolerance` excludes only BRIGHT outliers, not empty sky — and
  the fit skews. Crop-before-background is the pinned order.

**Stretch / colour:**
- Unlinked autostretch on a calibrated stack is the chroma-blotch ("rainbow")
  engine — after SPCC there is no cast to compensate; use linked. Unlinked
  sky-anchored stretch as a narrowband line-lift is a NO-OP (BGE+SPCC already
  equalize the channel skies; the line imbalance is OBJECT flux, not sky).
- SPCC narrowband equalizes O3=Ha and erases the O3 sphere (raw O3/Ha ~1.5 →
  ~1.0; sphere B/R 0.77 vs 3.21). Siril's own docs confirm SPCC-NB gives "real
  intensities"/"a huge green cast" and recommend Manual Color Calibration for
  SHO — i.e. for a narrowband SHO target, SPCC is the *cause* of the lost sphere,
  not the fix. (The star-colour-neutral fix is a candidate DESIGN, UNTESTED —
  `docs/narrowband-star-neutral-options.md`; not settled, do not cite as a method.)
- `rmgreen`/SCNR on a sky that is not green-dominant prints a global magenta cast.
- Siril has NO native GENERAL chrominance-noise tool (its own docs punt to GIMP,
  byte-identical disclaimer in 1.4.4 AND 1.5.0-dev). `rmgreen` IS a native
  SCNR-style filter but SINGLE-HUE (green cast only) — it does not close the general
  chroma gap. NEVER hand-roll a chroma coring; close the gap with an AI denoiser on
  x86 (tool options + their chroma-vs-luminance flags: `TOOLS.md`).

**Separation** (informs the x86 tool choice):
- A mask+inpaint separator DESTROYS resolved-object structure (inpaints HII knots
  out as stars, screens them back as blobs); a learned separator (StarNet2/StarXT)
  keeps field-star flux and far less object structure. Use the learned separator
  on resolved objects.
- A bright-star residual/shell is a per-DATA property (tight PSF vs big trailed
  PSF) — measure per dataset, never carry one set's number to another.

**Detection / solve / registration:**
- Frame QA + registration run on DEBAYERED data only — CFA-lattice registration
  false-positives on cloud texture (adjacent cloud frames cross-match → a cloud
  reference).
- **Siril's internal solver fails ultra-wide TRAILED fields — the blocker is its star
  MATCHER, not detection or catalogue depth (both tested and ELIMINATED).** Measured
  (36.45° field, correct centre from a blind solve, local Gaia, `-nocrop`): relaxed
  detection (`setfindstar -relax=on -roundness=0.05 -sigma=0.5`) raised candidates
  3316→8694 and still failed; `-limitmag=+4` raised the fetch 2177→138,498 Gaia stars
  (limit mag 7.81→11.81) and still failed — do NOT re-attempt those two knobs.
  `platesolve -localasnet` does not rescue it: it still feeds astrometry.net Siril's
  `findstar` PSF detection, which IS the failure mode (the FOV>5° detection auto-crop is
  *"Ignored for astrometry.net solves"*, so `-nocrop` is moot there). Side fact: Siril's
  AUTO limit mag for a 36° field is only 7.81 while detection goes far deeper — a
  population mismatch, not the blocker.
- **The fix: feed astrometry.net a SHAPE-BLIND xylist (its INTENDED override — solve-field
  on an xylist runs NO pixel extraction, matcher geometry-only, Lang 2010). Blind-solve
  first, label after.** Best source is SExtractor's core `sep`: returns trailed sources
  (median elongation ~1.3), blind-solves at HIGHER odds than in-house peak centroids
  (logodds 299 vs 289, scale Δ 1.2e-5), identical SPCC K — `solve_field.py` defaults to it
  (`extractor_ab.json`). Robustness ranking: (1) asnet + **sep** xylist; (2) in-house peak
  xylist (fallback, retirement pending); (3) `image2xy` xylist (shape-blind, untested — its
  trail knobs `-a`/`-p`/`-m` aren't exposed by solve-field and `-a` can fragment one trail
  into spurious detections); (4) `-localasnet` and ASTAP LEAST — both PSF-fit/roundness-gated
  (ASTAP docs: *"star streaks … will be ignored"*; wide DBs W08 FOV>20°, G05 FOV>6°, G17/H17/H18
  deprecated). Caveats: `--no-remove-lines --uniformize 0` (or list filters) still thin a
  supplied xylist; and two valid fits' centres can differ by hundreds of arcsec (the SIP
  wobble below), which never reaches SPCC (it re-matches stars from the seed).
- **Siril SPCC SIGSEGVs (exit 139) in aperture photometry when the sensor DATABASE
  is missing — not a data/field bug.** MEASURED on a fresh x86 rig: the crash hit
  at "Applying aperture photometry to N stars" on ANY star count (5305, 106, 291),
  any field size (full 20° or a 7.5° crop), and single- or multi-thread — because
  siril's SPCC sensor/filter/white-reference database dir was absent, so it applied
  a `(null)` sensor response and dereferenced it. The catalog (Gaia chunks) being
  present is NOT enough; the sensor database is a SEPARATE git repo. The tell is
  `spcc_list oscsensor` returning EMPTY and a log line "Unable to open directory:
  .../siril-spcc-database". Fix = clone it (CLAUDE.md Environment, SPCC
  prerequisites). Do NOT chase the star count, field width, catalog format, or bit
  depth — all ruled out; the crash prints nothing useful and mimics a data bug.
- 1-pass sequence-start registration strands drifting tail frames; 2-pass + low
  detection sigma recovers them; on trailed frames a reference sweep beats the
  auto-reference. Keep all frames (dropping a minority sub-focal subset buys no
  matching gain and pays the full √N noise penalty).
- **Wide UNTRACKED edge smear: "field rotation / gnomonic projection" is NOT the
  cause.** For an IDEAL rectilinear lens a pure camera rotation maps EXACTLY to an
  8-DOF homography (stars are at infinity; sky rotation is SO(3), linear in
  homogeneous coordinates) — zero residual. Szeliski, *Image Alignment and
  Stitching* §2.3, names the residuals that survive an optimal global fit, and for
  a star field only one applies: **unmodelled RADIAL LENS DISTORTION**. The real
  map is `distort ∘ H ∘ distort⁻¹`. Distortion displaces stars ∝ radius → centre
  sharp, edges smeared; as a star drifts it samples a different local distortion
  and no global fit absorbs the difference. So the fix is **undistort → homography**,
  NOT a local/elastic transform. Do not chase "better global transforms"
  (`-transf=` tops out at homography, which is already exactly right).
  MEASURED on a 43-min/1500-px-drift set, two independent ways: a 9-min
  (310 px) window is better whole-frame (majFWHM 3.87 vs 4.74 px) and undistorting
  the frames collapses Siril `seqtilt`'s off-axis aberration 0.57 → 0.25 px at FULL
  depth — remove the drift *or* remove the distortion and the homography becomes
  exact, which is the same statement twice
  ([`wide-field-untracked-registration.md`](wide-field-untracked-registration.md)).
  (The short-window arm's per-radius numbers came from a retired in-house radial
  metric — trap 3 below — and its stacks are gone, so they are not quoted; the
  whole-frame and `seqtilt` evidence above is what the conclusion rests on.)
- **astrometry.net's SIP is NOT a reproducible lens model at wide index scales — so
  `register -disto=` has no model to eat.** Fixed tripod (distortion physically identical
  every frame), yet two solves 43 min apart disagree at the same sensor positions by
  65 px median / 128 px worst (a real lens model must agree to ~1 px). A 1500-star cap cut
  it only to 44 px (worst 132) while sharply improving the LINEAR solve (RA-drift error
  6%→0.3%, logodds 127→782) — more stars fix the POSITION, not the distortion. Mechanism:
  the SIP tweak is constrained by *matched index* stars, and the 4200-series index at the
  scales an ultra-wide field needs (12–19) is Tycho-2-based and sparse. Feeding this SIP to
  `register -disto=` is a measured LOSS (whole-frame majFWHM 4.74→6.02 px, stars
  17,770→7,561, smear frame-wide); this also blocks WCS-reprojection (SWarp / astropy
  `reproject` need the same per-frame solution). **The lesson: for a wide UNTRACKED field,
  fit-distortion-from-sparse-trailed-stars is the dead end; an OFFICIAL *measured* lens
  profile is the route** (darktable + lensfun, `TOOLS.md` Tier 2b) — immune to index
  sparsity, and a measured WIN: `seqtilt` off-axis aberration (radial term) 0.57 → 0.31 →
  0.25 px, stars 5095 → 10707 → 11805, 54/54 registered (control → corrected → full depth).
  (Fitting from star correspondences BETWEEN frames — PixInsight/APP — is a different, viable
  mechanism; only the per-frame *catalog* solve fails.)
  **What the model does NOT buy (same runs):** sharpness is NULL (truncated-mean FWHM
  3.20 → 3.28 → 3.27 px — the in-exposure floor is untouched), and the one-sided component
  is NOT corrected (sensor tilt 0.50/16% → 0.42/13% → 0.51/16%) — a radial model cannot fix
  a one-sided term. It buys star COUNT and radial UNIFORMITY, not FWHM.
- **In-exposure trailing is the unremovable FLOOR** — no registration method touches
  it. On a fixed tripod at 6 s / dec +47 / 18″px it is ~3.4 px predicted and ~3.6 px
  measured (per-frame roundness 0.615, uniform across the set). Stars are elongated
  ~1.6:1 at BEST; success is the EDGE matching the CENTRE, never round stars. That
  the per-frame roundness is *uniform* is also the proof the radial smear is
  introduced by register+stack, not by the frames.
  **Measure note — the floor's px numbers are not one statistic.** ~3.4 is a predicted
  trail LENGTH; the ~3.6 per-frame FWHM was CFA-sampled (Bayer-inflated, relative-only
  — removal-condition register); station values are debayered majFWHM medians
  (3.4–3.8 px at the perpendicular stations); `seqtilt`'s truncated mean mixes axes
  and reads 3.0–3.1 px on the same stacks. Compare within one statistic; the operative
  claim is edge ≈ centre, never an absolute px value across statistics.
- **A community lens profile can fix the edges yet WRITE A NEW DEFECT into the centre —
  the paraxial-error × drift band.** True distortion → 0 at the optical axis, so an
  UNCORRECTED wide-untracked stack has a pristine centre; a community radial profile
  carries a small paraxial error ε(r), and as a star crosses the axis during the drift the
  radial unit vector flips sign, turning ±ε into a ~2ε smear ALONG THE DRIFT — a band
  through frame centre, worst at the centre, invisible perpendicular. MEASURED (findstar at
  fixed 350 px stations about the geometric centre): full-depth centre majFWHM 5.30 /
  roundness 0.480 vs perpendicular 3.60–4.12 / up to 0.706; the no-model control INVERTS it
  (centre 4.03/0.556, its best). It is a FAINT-star/texture defect (a stretch shows it,
  bright-star medians hide it), and **`seqtilt` is BLIND to it — off-axis aberration even
  IMPROVES as the centre degrades toward the corners' mean**, so never accept a
  wide-untracked render on `seqtilt` alone; measure fixed drift-axis stations
  (`scripts/qa/star_stations.py`). A tracked rig never sees it (no drift). **The fix: a
  model fitted FROM THIS UNIT'S OWN FRAMES by between-frame star-correspondence
  (`fit_lens_model.sh` → `install_lens_model.sh`)** — removes the band (centre 5.30 → 3.67 px
  at full depth, every station at the perpendicular floor) and sharpens the whole frame
  (`seqtilt` truncated-mean 3.27 → 3.06 px). ε-source candidates (open, fix is the same):
  centre-pinned a/b/c absorbing the calibrator's decentering; focus-distance; unit variation.
  Also KILLED: the solved effective focal (67.8) as the lensfun key — the interpolated 50–70
  model is WORSE at the centre (5.42 vs 4.88 px); calibrated focal=70 is the best community key.
- **A darktable lens STYLE carries NOTHING but the enabled bit.** darktable IGNORES the
  `op_params` blob (method/flags/camera/lens/focal/aperture/scale), re-detects the lens from
  each image's EXIF, and applies its DEFAULT correction set (distortion + TCA + **vignetting**).
  Measured (uniform/grid card, Siril `stat`): EXIF focal 70 vs 24 → opposite-sign fields
  (+26→+69 px vs −6→−19 px); `scale` 1.046 vs 0 vs 1.5 → identical to 0.000 px; a BLANKED blob
  (or flags 0–7, method/inverse flips) → byte-identical output. So ONE style is
  camera/lens/focal-general, and the correction SET cannot be chosen in a style — enforce it
  in the DATA lensfun reads: strip `<vignetting>`/`<tca>` from the lens's DB block
  (`install_lens_model.sh`) so distortion is the only correction darktable CAN apply (the
  unwanted vignetting DOUBLE-corrects flat-corrected lights — corner/centre 1.27–1.37× linear,
  2.2–2.6× stretched). Verify after any darktable/lensfun bump with a uniform-card warp: corner
  medians must equal centre — **but the uniform card ALONE is a VACUOUS test.** Warping a uniform
  field yields the same uniform field, so corner==centre passes whether vignetting was stripped OR
  the module never fired at all (MEASURED on x86: the uniform card's `lensdist` vs `nodist` renders
  came back PIXEL-IDENTICAL, Siril `isub` → "all nil", while the module was demonstrably live). It
  needs a GRID positive control that MUST differ (grid card gave sigma 45613–45620, max ~54000) to
  prove the module fires; only then does the uniform card's flat corner-vs-centre mean "no
  photometric correction". `scripts/darktable/verify_lens_card.py` runs both legs and fails if
  either fails. Do NOT compare the rendered files byte-wise — `cmp` reported those same
  pixel-identical renders as DIFFERING (TIFF metadata). This checks the correction SET, never its
  CORRECTNESS: a wrong-but-present distortion model passes both legs.
- **The trap (same mechanism, other side): a lens the DB cannot match gets NO correction,
  SILENTLY** — an unrecognised `LensModel` gave max |dr| = 0.000 px over 413 stars, exit 0, not
  one word in the log; a wrong-but-present lens is worse (a wrong, weaker model, also silent).
  darktable never degrades loudly, so a missing-lens set stacks UNCORRECTED and the only symptom
  is a worse `seqtilt` off-axis in the final. "Did the warp happen?" is NOT a sufficient guard
  (it passes the wrong-lens case): assert EXIF camera+lens+focal against the DB AND the set's
  `acquisition.json`, per set, BEFORE the run. Corollary: a mixed-focal/mixed-lens set is a HARD
  STOP, not an interpolation — every frame silently gets its own model.
- **Round-tripping linear astro data through a raw converter: MATCH the ICC tag, never
  "force linear".** Siril's `savetif` embeds **`sRGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc`** — an sRGB
  TONE CURVE — on LINEAR pixels, and **`icc_assign sRGBlinear` does NOT change what
  `savetif` embeds** (the export profile comes from a save-time preference; `set
  gui.icc_pedantic_linear=true` does not change it either). So a converter reading that
  TIFF applies an sRGB→linear DECODE to already-linear data. Exporting with a LINEAR
  profile (`darktable --icc-type LIN_REC709`) then leaves that decode UNCANCELLED:
  measured A_out/A_in climbing **0.1008 → 0.2121** across the brightness range
  (effective gamma ≈1.34) — silently destroying photometry, SPCC and the stretch while
  looking fine on a preview. **The fix is to MATCH the output profile to the input tag**
  (`--icc-type SRGB`): the decode and the re-encode cancel exactly — VERIFIED as an
  identity round trip, A_out/A_in = **0.9996–1.0000**, IQR 0.0003. The tag is
  "wrong" either way; what matters is that it is wrong *consistently*. Always verify
  linearity with star AMPLITUDES vs brightness (a constant ratio), never with a mean or
  a preview: a gamma preserves the median's rank order and hides in a stretch.
- **Three traps that make a registration comparison lie (all hit one set).**
  (1) **Survivorship bias** — a bad registration spreads flux below the detection threshold,
  so the SURVIVING stars' median can *improve* while the image gets worse (the `-disto=` LOSS
  above showed a BETTER edge median, 4.61 vs 6.46 px, on a destroyed frame). Read a star-shape
  metric with its **n** and confirm on full-frame crops.
  (2) **Area confound** — `-framing=min` gives each variant a DIFFERENT frame size (less drift
  ⇒ larger intersection), so raw counts aren't comparable (a short-window stack's higher count
  was entirely its 56% larger frame; per Mpx it was LOWER). Compare **stars per Mpx**, and open
  the detection gate (`setfindstar -roundness=0.05 -relax=on`) when measuring elongation or the
  metric silently rejects the stars under test.
  (3) **Circular metric** — a radial profile binned about the `findstar` BOUNDING-BOX centre
  has an origin that MOVES with the defect (the smear suppresses edge detections → box shrinks
  → origin shifts; **537 px** measured from a detection-sigma change alone), after which it
  reads roundness *improving* outward on a stack whose right third has no detections. Never key
  a metric to a geometry derived from the measurement itself — use a FIXED external origin or
  the tool's own measure (`seqtilt`, no origin to get wrong, but WHOLE-FRAME and blind to a
  drift-aligned band; `tilt`/`inspector` are script-NO). Star count per radial bin is not a
  quality measure either — it is sky density × detection efficiency, which peaks where the sky
  is poorest.
- Cloud culling is by per-pixel MAJORITY risk, not visibility: a moving minority
  band stacks clean through `rej 3 3`; a DWELLING band becomes the per-pixel
  majority and survives. `nstars` is a blind cloud discriminant on rich fields
  (detection saturates at the star cap — the background channel carries the cloud
  signal).
- wFWHM weighting at low FWHM spread is WORSE than none (Siril `-weight` is a
  min-max ramp → worst frame ~0 weight at any spread).
- Rejection and cosmetic correction CANNOT remove walking noise (drift-aligned
  streaks: sensor-fixed FPN dragged into lines by coherent un-dithered drift).
  The pattern is sub-sigma STRUCTURED signal, not discrete outlier pixels —
  measured NULL twice on a ~200-frame/half wide-untracked set: `-cc=dark`
  cosmetic correction, and GESD-vs-winsorized rejection (no visible or
  measured change either way). Size there: drift-phase structured term
  ≈0.34/0.48/0.42 ADU (R/G/B) per ~199-frame half vs ≈1.0/1.5/1.2 total
  static structure (`noise_split.sh`). Acquisition owns the fix (dither
  between subs); a denoiser is symptom budget only (BACKLOG item 11).
- **Never compose PRE-CROPPED per-set stacks to deliver a frame beyond any
  member's crop** — a per-set `-framing=min` stack has already discarded its
  outer drift zones, so a compose of such members has holes exactly where only
  the discarded zones covered (measured: a 5-member compose of per-set full
  stacks left a zero-coverage staircase across the cov25 frame's right region
  that the 107-sub-stack compose covers at Min 84–88 ADU). Compose from the
  UN-cropped sub-stacks. Two mechanisms measured alongside: `register -2pass`'s
  auto-reference sets the output CANVAS ORIENTATION and (via `-norm=addscale`)
  the composite's raw channel balance — `setref <n>` AFTER the 2pass re-bases
  both (a set-02-referenced compose read K_B 0.846 = that set's own balance and
  a rotated frame map; set-03-family reference restored K_B 0.951 and an exact
  map); and a crop-coverage guard of `Min > 0` PASSES on lanczos edge-ringing
  residue (Min 7–26 on a ~90 sky) — require the SIBLING-CLASS SKY FLOOR
  (Min ≈ 80s here), never mere non-zero.
- **Never sigma-reject across SUB-STACK composes.** Sub-stacks are clean
  ~group-size means, so their mutual scatter is ~√group below per-frame noise —
  a 3σ gate at that tiny σ fires on the systematic differences sub-pixel
  registration leaves along steep gradients (star edges, MW lanes), not on
  outliers. Measured (`rej 3 3` across 25 fifteen-frame sub-stacks vs a plain
  mean of the same registered set): pixels rewritten by up to **±3800 ADU on a
  ~140 ADU sky**, star cores carved out, dark rip-like streaks through
  structured regions — while whole-frame `seqtilt` medians stayed FLAT (stars
  13,903 vs 13,784; FWHM 3.07 vs 3.10), so the damage is invisible to
  frame-wide statistics and shows on the stretched final. Reject within groups
  (full per-frame strength, where satellites die); compose sub-stacks with a
  PLAIN MEAN.
- Drizzle: "short focal / large pixels ⇒ oversampled" is BACKWARDS (that geometry
  gives large arcsec/px → *few* px per star → UNDER-sampled, drizzle's home turf).
  Judge sampling by measured **minor-axis FWHM**, not the "wide" label: ≥~2–3 px =
  oversampled (skip), <2 px = undersampled (2× drizzle *can* help IF real
  sub-pixel dither + many registered frames). Trailed data is oversampled only
  where *trailing/bloat* spreads the star; drizzle is pointless there because
  trailing breaks the dither/registration preconditions AND drizzle can't de-trail
  (it renders a sharper *smeared* star). CFA-drizzle 1×/pixfrac 1.0 is a separate
  OSC-only win (cleaner colour noise). `docs/plate-solving-and-drizzle.md`.
- CLASSICAL deconvolution (makepsf + RL) where trailing is in-exposure fails —
  unstable symmetric PSF on ≈0 background. (A LEARNED deconvolver is NOT classical RL
  and is a live x86 option, not a dead-end — tool choice + CPU costs in `TOOLS.md`.)

**QA / scope:**
- The GATE must be a composition-agnostic STATISTICAL sky scope — whole-frame
  reads real MW/object signal as a defect, and a geometric sky mask can't fix it
  (a bright object has no fixed band). Hand-picked patches miss defects a
  whole-scope measurement catches (the lesson that created the gate).
- **Never read a LINEAR residual off a STRETCHED surface.** An autostretch places the
  sky low on a steep curve, so it can compress or amplify a background ratio by
  several× depending on where the background lands — the same class of gradient read
  "corner/centre 1.06" on an autostretched preview and **1.27–1.37 linear** on the
  shipped stack (2.2–2.6 in its stretched judge PNGs). A display-domain ratio answers
  "what does the eye see", never "how big is the residual": measure gradients with
  Siril `stat` regional medians on the LINEAR image, and state the domain with the
  number. (Same trap in reverse: a pedestal-included ADU ratio understates a light-
  domain falloff — a ~1 EV vignetting read "6.3%" with the ~1007 ADU pedestal in.)
- Never judge a denoiser by whole-frame `bgnoise`: the estimator conflates
  revealed texture with noise, so a real denoise can RAISE it (measured on one
  1024² tile: Siril `denoise` 2.05→2.55 while GraXpert denoise read 1.14 on
  the same input). Judge denoise on a decomposition instrument (the
  `noise_split.sh` structured term must SHRINK while confusion texture — real
  sky — stays) + the user's eyes on dust at 1:1.
- Never hide a rim defect with a darker sky target or a crop — the rim is in the
  data (estimator extrapolation × stretch amplification), fix it there.
- **Never export a numpy/FITS-row-order pixel box to Siril `crop` unverified** —
  Siril's crop y-origin is the OPPOSITE end (y_siril = H − y_np − h), so an
  unverified export ships a vertically mirrored window. Measured: a
  coverage-validated box (map Min = 25 sub-stacks everywhere in numpy coords)
  statted **Min 0** after export — a zero-coverage wedge shipped in a render.
  The guard is tool-sourced and cheap: crop the instrument MAP with the exact
  same args and require Siril `stat` to reproduce the claimed bound before any
  product crop.
- Compare finals in LIKE encodings (q92+4:2:0 loses star-edge chroma to
  subsampling). Judgment is the user's eyes on FULL-FRAME LOSSLESS finals
  (16-bit PNG only — never an 8-bit/reduced-depth/lossy copy), opened
  independently; one bracketed knob per experiment; nothing
  aesthetic commits before the user's eyes.

## Acquisition checklist — the real quality lever

Acquisition quality outranks processing; never bandaid what photons must fix.

- Record **14-bit Lossless-compressed** raw, NOT High-Efficiency (HE/HE★ is
  TicoRAW-compressed, lossy-ish, and forces a DNG fallback); confirm 14-bit
  (high-speed continuous can drop to 12-bit).
- Use the sensor's higher conversion-gain stage (a dual-gain CMOS drops read
  noise above its switch ISO); keep subs ≤ 500/focal-mm — star trailing, not read
  noise, caps sharpness on an untracked/lightly-tracked rig.
- MORE integration is the real lever: when band signal/grain ≈ 1, every processing
  knob is only polishing until more photons arrive.
- Flats per focal length used that night, BEFORE touching the zoom; METER to a
  ~50% histogram peak (don't trust a shutter value); diffuse the source (a bare
  screen shows its pixel grid). VERIFY uniformity: shoot a flat, rotate the camera
  180° against the source, shoot another — the two corner/centre ratios must match
  (an over-peaked source adds falloff the lens lacks and the flat is unusable; the
  lights' own sky corner/centre is the cross-check).
- Darks at the lights' exposure/ISO at night temperatures; biases at the flats'
  shutter (= exact flat-darks) — shoot them, it is 30 seconds.
- Lock the zoom ring (tape); don't touch the camera mid-set (a focal-length step
  forces a mixed-optics stack). Dither between subs; avoid the moon (star fringes
  on trailed PSFs are dispersion — physical, not removable in processing). Stop a
  fast lens down ≥1 stop for bright-star fields (wide open adds a red veiling-glare
  halo — an honest optical signature, not a bandaid to remove).
