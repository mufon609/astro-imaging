# docs/ — research deep-dives

Well-structured writeups of the knowledge-base research this repo does
between processing work. The harness's RECORD + AUDIT function extends to the
tool/technique landscape: this is where a session lands a **major deep-dive**
(a tool, a technique, a comparison, an open question) as a durable, cited
`.md` — before its conclusions graduate into the operating docs.

**Research only. No image processing happens here or anywhere in a research
session** (the repo drives industry tools; it never processes pixels itself —
`CLAUDE.md` "What this repo IS").

## The rules

- **One `.md` per MAJOR deep-dive.** Descriptive kebab-case name, e.g.
  `rc-astro-cli-linux.md`, `narrowband-star-neutral-options.md`,
  `siril-pyscript-headless.md`. Not one per web search — one per investigation
  that reaches a conclusion.
- **Findings are PROVISIONAL until empirically tested** (CLAUDE binding rule).
  Mark mechanism/research findings as such and name the test that would settle
  each.
- **Cite sources** (links). Prefer primary + recent (2025–2026).
- **Graduate durable findings.** docs/ is the deep record; the *operating*
  docs are the distilled truth. When a finding is solid, fold it into the
  right operating doc — a `TOOLS.md` tier entry, a `REDESIGN.md` dead-end, a
  `MEMORY.md` note — and record that graduation in the writeup. Don't let
  docs/ and the operating docs drift.

## Template (each deep-dive `.md`)

```
# <Topic> — deep dive

- **Question / scope** — what it investigates + why it matters to the harness.
- **Context** — date; tool/Siril versions; the rig constraints that bear on it
  (x86-64, no GPU, headless-preferred).
- **Findings** — the substance, organized.
- **Sources** — cited links.
- **Verdict / recommendation** — adopt / skip / alternatives, and why.
- **Status** — PROVISIONAL (mechanism/research) vs EMPIRICALLY TESTED.
- **Graduation** — what this changed in TOOLS.md / REDESIGN / MEMORY (or "none yet").
